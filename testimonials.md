<h2>Andy Gets His Questions Answered with a Shadow Day</h2>
<p>&#8220;Steve Cook and his team have been instrumental in the development of my business from before it was a graduate thesis until my official launch. He is an incredible resource, and has provided a wealth of information relating to the start up of my venture. The shadow day that was spent with Steve, his chaplains, his development team, and his clients <strong>answered many outstanding questions that had lingered</strong> and enabled me to witness the heart of his organization. Over the last few years, <strong>Steve has become a trusted friend and colleague</strong>, and I recommend his services very highly.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Dave Pursues His Calling</h2>
<p>&#8220;Steve Cook, of Corporate Chaplaincy Consulting, was <strong>extremely beneficial in the development stages of creating my own chaplaincy program</strong> for the Houston area. During my initial research of chaplaincy programs, my conversations with Steve confirmed the possibility of creating a uniquely personal service program that God had laid on my heart. His <strong>knowledge, experience, and detailed day-to-day operating wisdom</strong> gave me the context necessary in which to pursue my calling. Thank you, Steve, for the assistance you have been in my journey of chaplaincy work.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CCC Leads in the Field</h2>
