Steve Cook, the owner and founding chaplain, was working four days a week as an associate pastor, and he was only able to devote one day each week to his new chaplaincy organization. From 2005 to 2009, Capital Chaplains grew to require a full-time commitment, and the look of a typical week for the owner of this independent corporate chaplaincy organization has changed significantly.&#8221;_
