Confidentiality between workplace chaplains and those they serve is the lifeblood of the chaplaincy relationship. If confidentiality is compromised, the ability of the care-receiver to trust the chaplain is equally compromised, thereby severely limiting the ability of the chaplain to provide any further assistance.

Through the contextualizing of confidentiality in a variety of caregiving fields, this paper will make the case for the highest standards of confidentiality between workplace chaplains and care-receivers. We will begin by examining the role of confidentiality in related care fields such as healthcare and professional counseling, while keeping in mind that chaplaincy is a distinct profession. Additionally, we will explore the role of confidentiality in other chaplaincy disciplines. This paper concludes with an analysis of how other workplace chaplaincy providers have approached this topic and addresses the application of confidentiality to the profession of workplace chaplaincy as a whole.
