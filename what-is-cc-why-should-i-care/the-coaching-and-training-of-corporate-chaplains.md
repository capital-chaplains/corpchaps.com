“The Coaching and Training of Corporate Chaplains” sets the scene with a brief history of workplace trends that led to a split between people’s spiritual lives and their work. While there is a distinct focus on chaplaincy, O’Connell discusses the recent trends in which some companies, now seeing the need for outside help from management gurus and chaplains, have tried to reintroduce spirituality, in various forms, into the workplace. The article goes on to discuss the differences between a chaplaincy program and an Employee Assistance Program (EAP), and addresses what considerations there are for both companies and chaplains who are thinking about workplace chaplaincy. Legal issues, best practices, code of ethics, role of a chaplain, training, and the role of a chaplain when employees are terminated are just some of the issues about which O’Connell elaborates.
