## The Case for For-Profit Corporate Chaplaincy

Ministry is one thing. Starting a business is another. When starting a business, there are many questions to consider. When starting a chaplaincy business, there is one more: Would a for-profit or not-for-profit business model be best?

If you are coming from a non-profit background, it may seem easier to get people to support your cause if it is presented as a not-for-profit social venture. This, coupled with tax breaks that non-profits can offer to donors, can make finding investors seem less daunting, but it is important to think long term.

The ultimate goal is a sustainable business model that will be able to focus on providing chaplaincy services in the community for years to come. There are many ways in which for-profit corporate chaplaincy provides the ultimate business model with very attractive financial features for a variety of unique reasons. Because chaplaincy organizations have very little capital outlay, the for-profit model allows natural growth without the additional obstacle of fundraising in the traditional sense.

The owners of for-profit chaplaincy organizations can focus entirely on acquiring and serving clients, rather than having some of their focus, time, and attention diverted to the purpose of seeking and serving donors.

New contracts create income, and because the contracts are long-term retainer agreements, you’ll know you have consistent support that can be used to cover business expenses and hire quality chaplains to serve alongside you.

Why for-profit instead of non-profit?

*   Consistent cash flow
*   Easier to attract and retain talent
*   Inherently creates a customer-focused organization
*   Easier to relate to a business owner because you are one
*   Operating costs including office space, vehicle use, networking meals, etc. are tax deductible business expenses

With minimal competition in this emerging industry, chaplaincy as a business also has a tremendous amount of growth potential in the marketplace.

Other key benefits include:

*   Low upfront investment
*   Easy point of entry
*   Perfect home-office business
*   Work part or full-time
*   Low operating costs
*   Low risk
*   Local
*   Independent
*   Authentic
*   A recession-resistant business
*   No need for long term debt
*   Free of regulatory obligations
*   Definite need in the marketplace: people are hungry for hope
*   Your Return On Investment goes beyond the bottom line – you are impacting lives.

Leading, teaching, guiding, communicating, and helping others make up the foundation of a great chaplaincy business.

As when starting any new business, your chaplaincy organization may take awhile to develop into a self-sustaining entity. Consequently, it is important to have an alternate source of income during the first few years as you get your business off the ground. Meeting potential client companies, building trust, and earning their business takes time. When starting a for-profit chaplaincy organization, you can focus entirely on acquiring and serving clients without the distraction of diverting attention to the purpose of seeking and serving donors.
