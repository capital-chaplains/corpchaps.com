“Are you a chaplain?” The question makes sense, and I get it a lot when people find out that I work with Capital Chaplains. The answer, however, is: No.

My name is Cindy, and most of my life has been spent in education. As a teacher and a writer, my job has been to communicate new ideas to people. When asked to write about corporate chaplaincy, it seemed like a good fit. Corporate chaplaincy is a new idea, and many people still haven’t heard about chaplains in the workplace.

When I tell people that I’m currently writing about education or bullying, they tend to get an idea in their minds of what that is, and we move on, but people have questions about corporate chaplaincy.

To be honest, three years ago, when I first started writing about chaplaincy, I had more questions than answers. I had to devote far more time than usual to researching articles, and then I would be intrigued by yet another aspect of chaplains in the workplace that I didn’t yet have information about or hadn’t even known to research.

I would say that the articles and details that I have read about corporate chaplaincy have piqued my interest into the field, but talking with the chaplains, interviewing them, getting to know them, hearing about what they do: that has affected me more.

With confidentiality at a premium, there is only so much I could know about the true impact the chaplains were making on the lives of those they worked with. For a long time, it was all theory to me. It was all research articles, vague stories, and common sense. Then some employees wanted to share their personal experiences working with a chaplain, and I heard another side.

As a teacher, I had seen the personal lives of my students affect their ability to focus and function. I could relate to the managers who saw the personal lives of their employees affecting their work. You want to get to know those you spend your days with; you want to be there for someone who is hurting, but you also need to do your job and not let down everyone else who is counting on you (whether it be students, employees, or clients).

No one wants to see someone else going through a difficult time, but we don’t always know what to do to help, how to balance all the pulls on our time, and how to be there for everyone who needs us.

For me, with all the negative news that seems to get so much attention, it has been encouraging to spend time learning about, and getting to know, a group of people who love that it is their job to travel through the ups and downs of life with others, to listen, to problem solve, and to help people get back to a place where they can function, and even thrive, through the difficult times.
