title: Workplace Chaplain and Social Worker Profile
---
This document shares the experiences and insights of a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) who is currently serving part-time as a workplace chaplain (over two pagesâ€”1141 words).

_&#8220;Long before beginning her work as a chaplain, Sue made the decision to organize her fulltime work responsibilities so that they could be completed in four days each week. &#8230; When the opportunity arose to spend a few hours each Friday serving as a chaplain, Sue discovered that it was an excellent fit for her interests and her strengths. By dedicating just twelve to fifteen hours each month to chaplaincy, Sue has found a way to serve her community, supplement her income, and still enjoy her Fridays. &#8230;&#8221;_
