What are you good at? What comes so naturally to you that you know that you were just made to do it?

We are all gifted with unique strengths. Sometimes we are able to see the strengths and weaknesses in ourselves from a young age, finding as children that we are the ones our friends turn to when they need to talk, or noticing that we are the ones who always seem to be making peace among our siblings. In other cases, it can take us well into adulthood before we find that “perfect fit” where we feel like we are doing what we were made to do, if we find it at all.

There are vocational tests in career centers, churches, colleges, and anywhere else you find people trying to figure out how they can best use their gifts and skills to make this world a better place, and maybe find a way to pay the bills in the process.

Just knowing what you’re good at is only part of the equation. Knowing how to take those gifts and apply them is a key component where many people get stuck. In some cases, people find their passion and are determined to start a business doing what they love, only to find out that they have no idea how to run a business.

Do you have the gift of leadership? Are you a team builder? Do you have the gifts of discernment and mercy? Are you a care pastor who has no interest in business? Do you feel that your gifts and life experiences have prepared you to be a chaplain?

How can you know if chaplaincy is right for you?

What if you feel that those in the workplace would benefit greatly from having a chaplain there to walk alongside them, and you feel called to help, but you don’t feel that your gifts would make you a good workplace chaplain? Figuring out what your strengths are is the first step in finding out how your gifts can be applied to corporate chaplaincy.

Are you a born listener, a born organizer, or both? Is there a workplace chaplaincy organization in your area? Do they need chaplains? Do they need a web developer? Do they need administrative assistance?

Figuring out your strengths, and figuring out how they apply to chaplaincy, may surprise you. Is there a group of chaplains who need someone with a business background to help them start a chaplaincy organization to serve employees in your community? Maybe you are a chaplain who is searching for a business person to work with?

Understanding your gifts is the first step in determining whether God has called you to focus on serving as a full time chaplain, split your time between serving as a chaplain and establishing a chaplaincy organization in your region, or work in another way to support corporate chaplains so they can work one on one with employees.

What are you good at, and how have you been called to serve? Do you know? How can you find out?
