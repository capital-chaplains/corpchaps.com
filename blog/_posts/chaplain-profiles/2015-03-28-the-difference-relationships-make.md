Diane Hanson, former Development Director with [Capital Chaplains](http://www.capchaps.org) and [a business owner herself](http://www.thinkinginsync.com), loved her time as a corporate chaplain and the ways she was able to build real relationships with employees at the businesses she served.

Diane has great insight into people&#8212;an important skill for a chaplain. She understands that, in order to get through life, most people put up walls. Because corporate chaplaincy allowed her to consistently be present at workplaces, she was able to build relationships and trust with individuals&#8212;which meant that, when crises came, they knew she was someone whom they could share freely with and find help and compassion.
