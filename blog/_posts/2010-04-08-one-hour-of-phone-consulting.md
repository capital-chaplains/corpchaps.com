title: One hour of phone consulting
---
You can choose how this hour of phone consulting is spent. Ask any questions you want about the launch and operation of an independent corporate chaplaincy organization, or ask specific questions about Capital Chaplains. Seek counsel about the best way to approach your first prospective client company, or ask any questions that came to mind as you were reading through the documents downloaded from CorpChaps.Com—we highly recommend that you schedule this time after you have had the opportunity to look through the documents and compile a list of discussion topics and questions that you would like addressed.
