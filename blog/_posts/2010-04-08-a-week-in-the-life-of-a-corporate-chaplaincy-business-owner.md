title: A Week In The Life of A Corporate Chaplaincy Business Owner
---
This document offers a taste of what a corporate chaplaincy business owner does to prepare and serve on a weekly basis, addressing both a typical week as it was when corporate chaplaincy was a part-time venture, and how the schedule changed once running a corporate chaplaincy organization became a fulltime venture (over two pagesâ€”1154 words).

_&#8220;When Capital Chaplains first began to provide corporate chaplaincy services to the organizations in and around Madison, Wisconsin, it was a part-time venture. Steve Cook, the owner and founding chaplain, was working four days a week as an associate pastor, and he was only able to devote one day each week to his new chaplaincy organization. From 2005 to 2009, Capital Chaplains grew to require a full-time commitment, and the look of a typical week for the owner of this independent corporate chaplaincy organization has changed significantly.&#8221;_
