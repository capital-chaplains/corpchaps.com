What are you good at? What comes so naturally to you that you know that you were just made to do it?

We are all gifted with unique strengths. Sometimes we are able to see the strengths and weaknesses in ourselves from a young age. We might, for instance, find that we are the one our friends turn to when they need to talk, or we might notice that we always seem to play the role of peacemaker among our siblings. In other cases, it can take us well into adulthood before we find that “perfect fit” where we feel like we are doing what we were made to do, if we find it at all.

Just knowing what you’re good at is only part of the equation, though. Knowing how to take those gifts and apply them is also a key component, and that's where many people get stuck. In some cases, people find their passion and are determined to start a business doing what they love, only to find out that they have no idea how to run a business.

The best fit is when we figure out how we can best use our gifts and skills to make this world a better place and then can also find a way to pay the bills in the process.

##Chaplain or Business Owner?

Businesses need chaplains&#8212;but chaplains need someone with a business mind to create corporate chaplaincy organizations. If you feel called to corporate chaplaincy, how do you know which role is best for you? You might also be called to do both! Here are a few questions to consider:

* Do you have the gift of leadership?
* Are you a team builder?
* Do you have the gifts of discernment and mercy?
* Are you a care pastor who has no interest in business?
* Do you feel that your gifts and life experiences have prepared you to be a chaplain?

Understanding your gifts is the first step in determining whether God has called you to serve as a full-time chaplain, split your time between serving as a chaplain and establishing a chaplaincy organization in your region, or work in another way to support corporate chaplains so that they can work one-on-one with employees.

What are you good at, and how have you been called to serve? What will your next step be in exploring what God is calling you to?
