**Kathleen Kus, Service Advisor and Mechanic at the Engelhart Center**, explains how the chaplaincy program works at the Engelhart Center. While she had initial reservations when she began working at a company with a chaplain, she soon realized that it made sense. “We’re at work all day, every day, for our whole lives, and there’s obviously things that are happening outside of work that would potentially affect every aspect of your life, not just when your outside of work, but also when you’re in work.” Offering the chaplaincy program was a way for her boss to acknowledge the stresses of life while letting his employees know that he genuinely cared about them. “It’s nice to have a presence like that… Not only does our boss care about us, butSteve [Owner and Founding Chaplain of Capital Chaplains] cares about us.” Watch this video to see how one employee understands the program, and why she turned from a skeptic into a supporter.
