**Chuck Hohnbaum, Chief of Staff to the President at InterVarsity**, understands that “people come to work with a wide range of issues and concerns and burdens and joys in their lives. And to think that they don’t carry that into their work life would be a mistake. Our personal lives do make difference in how we work at the job. What the chaplaincy program does is it gives a safe place for people to think through and process with a trusted friend, someone that they can confide in, that’s not somebody they report to, it’s not somebody that they work with, but to begin to think through those issues that they’re bringing to work in a healthy, constructive way.” Watch this video to see how Hohnbaum has personally benefitted from the opportunity to have confidential conversations with the company chaplain, and how he has seen the chaplaincy program affect the culture of the organization “in a wonderful way.”
