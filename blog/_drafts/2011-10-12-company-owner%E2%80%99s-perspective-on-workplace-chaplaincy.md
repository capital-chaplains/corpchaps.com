title: Real Help for Real Businesses

Mike Coyle, owner of Coyle Carpet and a client of [Capital Chaplains](http://www.capchaps.org), is thankful for the many gifts corporate chaplaincy has brought to his business.

## A Crisis, a Corporate Chaplain, and Content Employees

Mike initially asked me for help when he had an employee in crisis. Pleased with the results of that situation, Mike rolled out the program to the whole staff. “It’s difficult enough to run a business,” Mike says. “We’d like to be able to help our employees through some of the crises, and we can do it now with the corporate chaplaincy.”

While some employees had initial reservations, Mike explains that after seeing the chaplaincy program in action, 95 percent of his employees are now using the program. Their corporate chaplain, Terry, has even performed weddings for employees. Through crises, deaths, and marriages, Terry has been there for employees&#8211;which makes them feel cared for, and Mike, a happy business owner.
