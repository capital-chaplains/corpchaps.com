In today’s pressure-packed business environment, it’s not just the economy people are stressing about. It’s the relentless pace of life that wears people down – leading to lower productivity, low morale, interpersonal conflicts, and high absenteeism. Feeling overwhelmed has become the new “normal” for most Americans, and it is taking its toll in the workplace.

Most people have heard about chaplains in the military and in hospitals. Capital Chaplains brings this same kind of personal care to corporations. Companies throughout Madison and South Central Wisconsin are discovering what companies around the country have been experiencing for years: offering a chaplain who is available to serve employees as part of an employee benefits package allows employers the opportunity to demonstrate that they care for their employees while helping their bottom line.

Having a chaplain on site weekly, and available by phone 24/7/365 in case of an emergency, crisis, or other need, supports business owners and employees while reducing employee turnover. Having the chaplain work through a crisis with an employee allows supervisors and fellow employees the chance to stay focused on their jobs during the work day, which helps keep the company running smoothly. With its personal, on site component, companies offering chaplain programs report much higher usage rates than those using traditional EAPs, simply because of the relational nature of corporate chaplaincy.
