When someone hears of workplace chaplains, they may have a lot of things come to mind.  I’m guessing most would think, “Oh, that’s nice.”  Aside from that, they may not give it a lot of thought.  If a business owner heard of it, they may also see the benefits of having someone on hand for staff to talk with about their problems, but they’d also see it as an expense.

If I was to tell them that there is actually a return on their investment, they might give it more consideration.

Well – how does a potential of 20:1 ROI sound?  Here is just one example &#8211; think for a moment how much it costs to replace an employee.  If you have a fairly high turnover rate, this is something you can relate to.  Turnover cost can range between 50-150% of an employee’s annual salary.  Chaplain Assistance Programs (CAP) helps keep employees happy and therefore, you have less turnover.  Employees who work for a company that offers a CAP is often willing to work harder and are more productive and loyal simply because they respect that the company really cares about them as a human being.

The other day I was talking with a business woman who had just heard about workplace chaplains.  She said, ���Wow, companies really offer this for their employees?  That is really awesome.  A company that would be willing to invest in their employees like that are quite admirable.”  She has been in the business world for many years and agrees that we are on to something.  She said she believes caring for employees is the root of every success.

Each of us experience personal problems from time to time.  We will also all face a crisis, whether we want to or not.  We deal with these challenges; then go to work.  Guess what?  It follows us.  When it follows us, it does affect how well we do our job and can also affect others we work with.

I’ve also heard that many managers really appreciate the assistance and expertise of a chaplain.  They often do not have the time or knowledge as to how to help an employee with their problems.  In fact, 50% of a managers time can be spent dealing with employee issues – many of them personal.  They are happy to have a chaplain deal with these issues so they can get back to work.  This all provides greater productivity.

As a business leader, you have been given much – and much is expected.  Providing a foundation for your employees and company to build on is the key to overall success.
