title: Introducing a great team
---
Behind the implementation of every great idea is a great team. As the point person for that team, it is important to not only know your strengths, but to see the strengths in others that compliment yours, and bring those people together to work with you.

I am pleased to introduce the initial workplace chaplaincy blog contributors associated with the CapChaps.Org and CorpChaps.Com sites.

I am delighted that Cindy Liu, writer and researcher, will be one of the blog contributors. Cindy and I have collaborated on much of the material found on the CapChaps.Org and CorpChaps.Com sites. Through her many hours of workplace chaplaincy research and writing, and through her thoughtful contribution to this emerging field, Cindy has become a de facto expert in the field of workplace chaplaincy. Watch for Cindy’s insights as she shares much of what she has learned about both the theory and practice of workplace chaplaincy.

The third key contributor in this initial blog launch is Diane Hanson: Development Director with Capital Chaplains, corporate chaplain, and owner of a revenue development company she founded called Thinking In Sync LLC. She is also the author of the book entitled Full Circle: Fulfilling the Promise. Diane brings an amazing ability to incorporate spiritual caregiving with sound business principles. Watch for Diane’s insights into both the business and personal Return on Investment found in workplace chaplaincy.

We will also be inviting guest contributors to blog from time to time.

I want to thank two additional members of our Social Media Team: Matt Cook, who takes care of all things technical and programmable for us, and Carrie Vick, who serves as our Social Media Intern.
