She feels that the relational nature of the chaplaincy program allows employees to meet and get to know the chaplains before a crisis hits, making it easier to turn to them when help is needed. Incorporating her background in business and her desire to help those in need, Hanson has found workplace chaplaincy to be a perfect fit for her.');

					Steve Cook, of Corporate Chaplaincy Consulting, was extremely beneficial in the development stages of creating my own chaplaincy program for the Houston area. During my initial research of chaplaincy programs, my conversations with Steve confirmed the possibility of creating a uniquely personal service program that God had laid on my heart. His knowledge, experience and detailed day-to-day operating wisdom gave me the context necessary in which to pursue my calling. Thank you Steve for the assistance you have been in my journey of chaplaincy work.</div><div class="source">

					<p>Our mission as a consulting team is to mentor and equip emerging workplace chaplains. Our vision as chaplains is to reach out and bring care where it is needed most and where it can make a meaningful difference.</p>
					<p>
					The tangible benefits of corporate chaplaincy are numerous:  from improved attitudes, cooperation, and performance to increased loyalty and commitment to the job. Decreases in anxiety and stress coupled with greater company loyalty all result in a lower turnover rate and higher productivity which have a direct positive impact on the bottom line.</p>
