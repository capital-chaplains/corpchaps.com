"John McKibbon, President &amp; CEO, McKibbon Hotel Management, Inc. (45 Properties)","Because I realize how tough and tiresome the jobs of our hotel staff can be, I want to give our employees more than just a pay check for their labor.

Now I provide them qualified chaplains they can call on at any time with no tie back to the company; men and ladies they can talk to confidentially, knowing it will not go back to management"
