## Workplace Chaplaincy

###  Life is hard . . . then we go to work.

As a business owner, you know this is true for you and your employees. The difference is you
				have a vested interest in your business. What about your employees? The new and effective
				solution: workplace chaplains. Chaplaincy is about confidentially caring for your employees
				in a compassionate and non-judgmental way so they can be their best at work. Workplace
				chaplains give the gift of hope! Watch this video to see how owners and employees are
				enjoying the benefits of having a corporate chaplain in the workplace.
