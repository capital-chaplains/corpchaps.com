<h2>What is Corporate Chaplaincy?</h2>
<p>The current economic crisis is taking its toll on more than just people&#8217;s pocketbooks. The additional emotional stress is hitting families, and many Americans are taking this stress to work with them each day. Even when the economy is strong, the fast pace, pressures, and distractions of everyday life create the reality that many employees are barely able to hang on. Working beyond the forty-hour work week, fulfilling the responsibilities of home, running tired and overwhelmed much of the time: all contribute to the fact that many people today have run out of margin in their lives and do not have anyone to turn to during the challenging times of life. Difficulties and challenges that employees face outside of the workplace come to work with them and result in low productivity, low morale, and high absenteeism.</p>
<h2>Even successful business leaders often wonder:</h2>
<ol>
<li>What is the best way to support employees and help them focus when they or members of their immediate families and households are:
<ul>
<li>Struggling with a debilitating illness?</li>
<li>Struggling with substance abuse?</li>
<li>Burdened with personal problems?</li>
<li>Incarcerated?</li>
<li>Suicidal?</li>
<li>Experiencing grief?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is an appropriate way for business owners or managers to respond in these difficult situations?</li>
<li>How would the situation be different if a chaplain were available?</li>
</ol>
<h2>Real World Statistics</h2>
<ul>
<li>Despite a softening economy and corporate downsizing, 75% of employers named employee retention as their top benefits objective. And 58% of these employers find that developing a benefits program that helps employees balance work and life is the most important way to retain employees. 1</li>
<li>Over half (54%) of all unscheduled absences reported in a 2006 survey were the result of family issues, personal needs, and stress. 2</li>
<li>80% of workers feel stress on the job, with nearly half saying that they need help learning to manage stress; 42% say their coworkers need such help. 3</li>
<li>More than 52% of human resource professionals reported that they have been approached by employees at their organizations who are having a difficult time focusing on their tasks at hand. In addition, over 70% reported that they have been approached by employees who feel they have trouble achieving work/life balance. 4</li>
<li>87% of workers are seeking or have sought companies that were flexible, supportive and understanding of personal and family needs. 5</li>
</ul>
<h2>An Idea Whose Time Has Come: Workplace Chaplaincy</h2>
<p>Having tested the concept and practice of corporate chaplaincy in nine Dane County companies over the last five years, I am convinced that workplace chaplaincy is an idea whose time has come.</p>
<ul>
<li>People bring their personal concerns and problems with them to work every day, and the result has a profound impact on morale and productivity.</li>
<li>Fewer and fewer people are turning to traditional forms of community (whether family, neighbors, or faith communities) for assistance with life’s problems.</li>
<li>Broad-based company wellness programs are becoming commonplace.</li>
<li>People spend the majority of their waking hours at work.</li>
<li>Corporate chaplaincy has bottom line benefits for both employers and their employees.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What do employees want?</h2>
<p>In a survey conducted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the following responses were reported from management and employees respectively:</p>
<h3>Management responded that employees want:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Good wages</li>
<li>Job security</li>
<li>Promotions</li>
</ol>
<h3>Employees responded that they want:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Appreciation</li>
<li>Feeling “in” on things</li>
<li>Help with personal problems</li>
</ol>
<p>Corporate chaplaincy has been raised up to address these very real employee needs.</p>
<h2>Major Marketplace Trends</h2>
<p>For just a moment, review the major trends affecting the business environment over the last five decades:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1960’s: The Civil Rights Movement</strong> resulted in the development of race-friendly policies that encouraged integration and racial equality.</li>
<li><strong>1970’s: The Modern Feminist Movement</strong> resulted in gender-friendly policies that were designed to make women feel more welcome at all levels of an organization.</li>
<li><strong>1980’s: Changing Family Systems</strong> resulted in a variety of family-friendly policies that reached out to parents in changing families.</li>
<li><strong>1990’s: The Enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act</strong> resulted in policies and laws that worked to create disability-friendly work environments, and the <strong>Gay-Rights Movement</strong> resulted in sexual orientation-friendly policies; both worked to reduce discrimination and encourage inclusion.</li>
<li><strong>2000’s: An Emphasis on Wellness</strong> has resulted in some companies creating environments that encourage a more balanced and holistic work environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above outline is adapted from David Miller, founding Director of the Princeton University Faith &amp; Work Initiative, and points out the unmistakable trend that more and more companies are seeking to create environments where employees are comfortable bringing their whole selves to work. 6</p>
<h2>What is a Chaplain Assistance Program (CAP)?</h2>
<p>A Chaplain Assistance Program (CAP) is a personal, voluntary, and confidential benefit available to employees and their households and immediate families; sponsored by the company, chaplains are provided by a corporate chaplaincy provider.</p>
<h3>Key features of a Chaplain Assistance Program include:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Benefits that are voluntary but available to all employees and their households and immediate family members who choose to participate.</li>
<li>Benefits at no cost to the employee.</li>
<li>Chaplains who are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.</li>
<li>Chaplains who are neutral from company operations.</li>
<li>An assurance of confidentiality; personal information will not be revealed to management or any other person (except where dictated by law).</li>
</ul>
<h3>What do the following companies have in common?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tyson Foods – Fortune 100, publicly traded, 114,000 employees.</li>
<li>Coca-Cola Bottling Co. – publicly traded, 6,000 employees.</li>
<li>American LubeFast – private, 500 employees.</li>
<li>Pellitteri Waste Systems Inc. &#8211; private, 50 employees.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: they all have company sponsored Chaplain Assistance Programs.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Caring for Employees</h2>
<p>Most employers recognize that absenteeism and turnover can create a significant cost to the business or corporation. In addition, an employee who is focused on a personal problem rather than on work is sometimes the cause of expensive errors or accidents. Being proactive in caring for the life, emotional, and spiritual needs of employees can actually save a company money in the long run.</p>
<h3>The implementation of a Chaplain Assistance Program (CAP):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Reduces costly consequences of poor problem solving (e.g. suicide, substance abuse, workplace violence, and/or sabotage, etc.).</li>
<li>Increases early awareness of and intervention in situations of physical or emotional overload and onset of related physical and emotional dysfunction.</li>
<li>Provides a source of support and resources in times of personal crises.</li>
<li>Improves attitudes, cooperation, and performance.</li>
<li>Increases loyalty and trustworthiness.</li>
<li>Increases dedication to company goals, priorities, and objectives.</li>
<li>Reduces staff conflicts.</li>
<li>Decreases anxiety and tensions.</li>
<li>Contributes to the safety of the workplace environment.</li>
<li>Serves the company values.</li>
<li>Increases commitment to the job and reduces absenteeism.</li>
<li>Helps employees become more productive.</li>
</ul>
<p>The leaders of major companies across the country have seen first-hand the benefits of offering a workplace chaplaincy program. Here&#8217;s what they have to say about their experiences:</p>
<p>&#8220;Pettus has studied the costs and benefits of a workplace chaplaincy program and concluded that they more than pay for themselves in terms of lower turnover, higher morale, and healthier staff. By way of example, Pettus shared that some union employees—who happened to be a group of single mothers—approached him and said that, if tough economic conditions meant the workplace chaplaincy program night have to get cut, they were willing to give up other benefits instead so as to keep that one. In thirty years of work in human relations, he had never heard such an offer.&#8221; 6</p>
<p>&#8220;While measuring the tangible, monetary benefits of chaplaincy programs can prove difficult, both [John Tyson, Chairman and CEO of Tyson Foods and Robert Pettus, Jr., Vice Chairman of Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated] agreed that the programs were huge successes. After a nine month study, Coca-Cola Bottling concluded that their newly introduced chaplaincy program contributed to improvements in morale, productivity, safety, and quality.&#8221; 7</p>
<p>&#8220;Embry [Tim Embry, CEO of American LubeFast, a Georgia-based chain of 70 oil change and auto maintenance shops in the South that employs about 500 persons] reported that since he implemented the chaplaincy program&#8230; his employee turnover rate and product shrinkage (losses due to theft) declined dramatically. He described the chaplaincy program as &#8216;an employee assistance plan on steroids&#8217; and recommended that other business leaders involve their companies. Said Embry, &#8216;Do it. You will be rewarded.&#8217;&#8221; 8</p>
<h2>Corporate Chaplaincy Makes Sense</h2>
<p>The tangible benefits of corporate chaplaincy are numerous: from improved attitudes, cooperation, and performance to increased loyalty and commitment to the job. Decreases in anxiety and stress coupled with greater company loyalty result in a lower turnover rate and higher productivity; all of which have a direct positive impact on a company&#8217;s bottom line.</p>
<p>More and more businesses in the United States and around the world are realizing that by taking appropriate care of their employees, the employees are more able to effectively take care of business. These companies are discovering the human resource and bottom line benefits of having a chaplain on the premises and available by phone 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, in case of an emergency, crisis, or other need. Through a Chaplain Assistance Program, employers can demonstrate that they care about those they lead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some companies are adding a new position to the staff: a corporate chaplain. It&#8217;s not about religion. It&#8217;s about increasing productivity.&#8221;<br />
ABC News</p>
<p>Offering a CAP as an optional employee benefit provides the needed competitive edge when it comes to hiring top talent. Additionally, companies offering CAPs report much higher usage rates than traditional Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs), simply because of the relational nature of corporate chaplaincy. As the Tim Embry, the CEO of American LubeFast, said, &#8220;Starting our chaplaincy program was the best thing I have ever done in business.&#8221;</p>
<p>Workplace chaplains reach out and bring care where it is needed most, and where it can make a meaningful difference.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">&#8220;While measuring the tangible, monetary benefits of chaplaincy programs can prove difficult, both [</span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">John Tyson, Chairman and CEO of Tyson Foods and Robert Pettus, Jr., Vice Chairman of Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated] </span></span><span style="font-size: x-small;">agreed that the programs were huge successes. After a nine month study, Coca-Cola Bottling concluded that their newly introduced chaplaincy program contributed to improvements in morale, productivity, safety, and quality.&#8221; </span><sup><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a name="sdfootnote6anc"></a></span></span></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">&#8220;Pettus has studied the costs and benefits of a workplace chaplaincy program and concluded that they more than pay for themselves in terms of lower turnover, higher morale, and healthier staff. By way of example, Pettus shared that some union employees—who happened to be a group of single mothers—approached him and said that, if tough economic conditions meant the workplace chaplaincy program night have to get cut, they were willing to give up other benefits instead so as to keep that one. In thirty years of work in human relations, he had never heard such an offer.&#8221; </span><sup><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a name="sdfootnote7anc"></a></span></span></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">&#8220;Embry [</span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Tim Embry, CEO of American LubeFast, a Georgia-based chain of 70 oil change and auto maintenance shops in the South that employs about 500 persons] </span></span><span style="font-size: x-small;">reported that since he implemented the chaplaincy program&#8230; his employee turnover rate and product shrinkage (losses due to theft) declined dramatically. He described the chaplaincy program as &#8216;an employee assistance plan on steroids&#8217; and recommended that other business leaders involve their companies. Said Embry, &#8216;Do it. You will be rewarded.&#8217;&#8221; </span><sup><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a name="sdfootnote8anc"></a></span></span></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" lang="en"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Corporate Chaplaincy Makes Sense</strong></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" lang="en"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The tangible benefits of corporate chaplaincy are numerous: from improved attitudes, cooperation, and performance to increased loyalty and commitment to the job. Decreases in anxiety and stress coupled with greater company loyalty all result in a lower turnover rate and higher productivity; both of which have a direct positive impact on the company&#8217;s bottom line.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" lang="en"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Corporate chaplaincy makes sense. Take appropriate care of your employees, and they will take care of business. Hundreds of companies are discovering the human resource and bottom line benefits of having a chaplain on the premises and available by phone 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, in case of an emergency, crisis, or other need. Through a Chaplain Assistance Program, employers can demonstrate that they care about those they lead.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span lang="en">&#8220;Some companies are adding a new position to the staff: a corporate chaplain. It&#8217;s not about religion. It&#8217;s about increasing productivity.&#8221;</span></span></em><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span lang="en"><br />

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Offering a CAP as an optional employee benefit provides the needed competitive edge when it comes to hiring top talent. Additionally, companies offering CAPs report much higher usage rates than traditional Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs), simply because of the relational nature of corporate chaplaincy. As the Tim Embry, the CEO of American LubeFast, said, &#8220;</span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><em>Starting our chaplaincy program was the best thing I have ever done in business.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" lang="en"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Chaplains reach out and bring care where it is needed most and where it can make a meaningful difference. </span></p>
