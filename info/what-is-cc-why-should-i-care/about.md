				<p>Welcome to the Corporate Chaplaincy Consulting website, where our mission is: <strong>to mentor and equip emerging corporate chaplains.</strong></p>
<p>My name is Steve Cook, and in 2005 I started Capital Chaplains LLC, a corporate chaplaincy initiative based near Madison, Wisconsin, which serves the entire Capital Region of South-Central Wisconsin. By 2009, Capital Chaplains had contracts to provide a Chaplain Assistance Program for every employee and related family/household member in each of nine client organizations.</p>
<p>As a former local church pastor, I not only lead this chaplaincy initiative on a full-time basis, but I have contracted with six other part-time chaplains to assist me with the work. From 2005 to 2009, Capital Chaplains grew from a part-time venture to full-time income, with this growth occurring during the worst recession since the great depression. Five of the nine Capital Chaplains client companies started chaplaincy programs in 2009 alone! Since chaplains are onsite to walk alongside workers through the joys and struggles of whatever life brings, corporate chaplaincy is a growth industry in and out of a business downturn.</p>
<p>Every month I receive inquiries from people around the USA just like you, who have an interest in corporate chaplaincy and have extensive questions about this new initiative. As a result, we at Corporate Chaplaincy Consulting and Capital Chaplains have come together to create a site that will provide a variety of resources and documents written for both prospective chaplains and those looking to start their own local chaplaincy initiatives. We will take you behind the scenes and through the details of how Capital Chaplains was developed—including both the materials that we have developed along the way (that I wish I had in 2005!) and the lessons that we have learned over the years—all with the goal of helping you as you venture into the emerging industry of corporate chaplaincy.</p>
<p>All the best as you begin this next step on your journey.</p>
