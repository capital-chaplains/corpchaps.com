<h2>What is a corporate chaplain?</h2>
<ul>
<li>A corporate chaplain is a dealer in hope.</li>
<li>A corporate chaplain works to advance the common good.</li>
<li>A corporate chaplain practices the Ministry of Presence on a daily basis.</li>
<li>A corporate chaplain provides help and hope one person at a time.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why consider a career as a corporate chaplain?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps you enjoy serving people and thrive on building hope in others.</li>
<li>Perhaps you are a social worker who is searching for a new job.</li>
<li>Perhaps you are a professional counselor who is looking for a career change.</li>
<li>Perhaps you are looking for some extra income but don’t have the time or resources to go back to school and retrain for a new occupation.</li>
<li>Perhaps you want to move into the retirement phase of life but feel that your work is not finished.</li>
<li>Perhaps you are a pastor in search of a new calling—after spending years in ministry as a pastor, you find that your time is now spent leading programs, raising money, and overseeing a church campus, rather than ministering directly to people—and now you feel that you are being called back to a profession where you can once again minister directly to people.</li>
</ul>
<p>Different people come to corporate chaplaincy from different backgrounds and for different reasons. Whether you have been laid-off, are currently feeling burned-out, or are searching for a new calling, if you can relate to any of the above, serving as corporate chaplain may be right for you. CorpChaps.Com is designed to be a step-by-step guide to show you how to get started.</p>
<h2>Who could be a corporate chaplain?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Hospital or military chaplains</li>
<li>Pastors, priests, and ministers</li>
<li>Counselors or social workers</li>
<li>Spiritual directors, para-church staff, Stephen Ministers, and other lay-church leaders and staff</li>
<li>Marketplace leaders who are people of faith and have experience leading and coming along-side others</li>
</ul>
<p>The vast majority of the approximately 4,000 corporate chaplains currently serving in the United States are professionally trained in another discipline.
