<p><em>&#8220;As the sole pastor of a small church, Mickey recognizes that the amount of time that can be devoted to ministry is endless; you can always do more, pray more, and study more. While he didn&#8217;t feel that he had the time to add anything else to his busy schedule, he made time. Two years ago, when Mickey was presented with the opportunity to work as a part-time chaplain, he saw it as an extension of his ministry—and an opportunity to help him support his family of five. &#8230; While the employees benefit from Mickey&#8217;s consistency, encouragement, and desire to listen, he has found that he benefits from his time with them as well. &#8230;&#8221; </em></p>
