<p><em>&#8220;Our company has been recognized as one of Fortune’s ’Best Companies to Work For’ for the last three years. The chaplain program is a low-cost employee benefit that has gotten us more loyalty than our other ’standard’ benefits and resulted in lower turnover, improved morale and a general sense of ’caring’ on the company’s part about our employees’ well being.&#8221;</em><br />
~ <strong>David M. Weekley, Chairman of the Board, David Weekley Homes</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;We recognized that we needed to try to deal with our employees as whole employees&#8211;bodies, mind, and soul. It&#8217;s been enthusiastically embraced by our employees, primarily because it&#8217;s completely non-intrusive.&#8221;</em><br />
~ <strong>Lauren Steele, VP of Corporate Affairs, Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated</strong></p>
<p><em>“One of our main goals is to help people be comfortable bringing their whole selves to work. We believe a person doesn’t check their faith at the door when they arrive in the morning.”</em><br />

<p><em>&#8220;People spend the majority of their working lives here, and I believe that if we recognize their needs and try to create a climate that makes them better people, the byproduct will be better, happier, and more productive associates.&#8221;</em><br />
~ <strong>Patrick Flood, CEO HomeBanc</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Because I realize how tough and tiresome the jobs of our hotel staff can be, I want to give our employees more than just a pay check for their labor. I want to give them even more than my personal care and concern. Now I provide them qualified chaplains they can call on at any time with no tie back to the company; men and ladies they can talk to confidentially, knowing it will not go back to management.&#8221;</em><br />
~ <strong>John McKibbon, President &amp; CEO, McKibbon Hotel Management, Inc. (45 Properties)</strong></p>
<p><em>“One of the most gratifying things about having a chaplain for our employees is watching the changes in their lives as a result of the program. We are in our fifth year of the program and every year it gets better. In my forty years in business this is the only benefit that my employees have ever actually thanked me for and it happens all the time.”</em><br />
~ <strong>Vaughan Dunnavant, Chairman, The Dunmar Companies</strong></p>
<p><em>“I have no doubt based on story after story as to the program’s human and bottom-line value.”</em><br />
~ <strong>John Tyson, Chairman &amp; CEO, Tyson Foods</strong></p>
<p><em>“At first our leadership team didn’t think the idea of having a chaplain coming around here was such a good idea; now they are all the biggest cheerleaders of the program. I can recommend the program without reservation.”</em><br />
~ <strong>Tom Vande Guchte, President, Storr Office Environments</strong></p>

<p><em>“This is one of the best business decisions we have ever made.”</em><br />
~ <strong>David Clark, President, Thomas and Howard</strong></p>

~<strong> Cecil McCord, President, Garage Doors of Indiana</strong></p>
<p><em>“Even though we have a very diverse workforce both culturally and educationally, the chaplains who serve our organization blend right in and take care of everyone regardless of their background or beliefs.”</em><br />
~ <strong>Dr. Stephen Scott, President, Phy America Physicians Group, Inc.</strong></p>
