title: What’s the Power of a Good Story?
---
A good story is powerful. Stories help us connect to a person and relate to their life.

I could research the track record of corporate chaplaincy for weeks, but it&#8217;s the stories I hear&#8211;and get to be part of myself&#8211;about the positive difference corporate chaplains make in people’s lives that make me really take notice and get excited.

A good story is what we remember when all the statistics get jumbled in our minds (was it 34 percent or 43 percent?). Numbers are easy to forget.

But stories are about people, not numbers.

Chaplains can’t (and won’t) tell you too much about how they help individual employees. That’s a good thing, because then you know that you can trust them with the issues in your own life. You know it’s safe. At the same time, it makes it difficult. How is it possible for companies considering chaplaincy to truly understand the important role chaplains have played in people’s lives? How can they see how having a chaplain can truly be just what an employee needs to turn things around and get back on track?

Employees whose lives have been touched know how important the chaplaincy service is, but everyone else just has to trust? Maybe not. Maybe, the power of a story will help the rest of us understand.

When you have employees who want to share, employees who know how their lives have been touched, and they are hoping to use their experiences to reach others. They are willing to tell their stories so that the rest of us on the outside can better understand.

Recently, the weekly blogs have featured video interviews. For the next several weeks, they will continue to feature real people telling their stories. They may not share all the personal details of everything they went through, but you will see people coming forward saying:

My life has been touched, and now I’m on the other side of my crisis, thanks to my corporate chaplain.

What’s the power of a story? When we can relate, when we can see ourselves, our friends, or our employees in the story that we are hearing, then we can understand, and maybe we don’t feel quite so alone.

This week, Nou Her has chose to share her story about when life got just a bit too chaotic.

Ever been there? Ever had one of your employees there? How might a corporate chaplain have helped?
