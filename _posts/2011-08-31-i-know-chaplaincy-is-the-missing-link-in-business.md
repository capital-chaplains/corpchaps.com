I know that Corporate Chaplaincy delivers the missing link in business.

I’ve been dealing with people in many capacities in my career and personal life – mostly in marketing and ministries.  Time and time again I’ve learned just how much someone’s personal situation or outlook can greatly impact their job and how well they do it.

I’m Diane Hanson, Development Director with Capital Chaplains and the owner of my own company, [Thinking In Sync](http://www.thinkinginsync.com/), a revenue development consulting business.

Most of the 25 years of my career I’ve worked either IN a sales capacity, or in one of consulting or coaching individuals who have an effect on the companies’ sales – either directly or indirectly.  When I’ve “broken through the wall” of individuals, I learn they almost ALL have something they are struggling with.  I also knew that I could try my hardest to train or coach them to be better at their jobs or sell more, but what was really needed was a way to care for their spirit.  If their spirit was depleted or if they were experiencing personal problems (and believe me, there are _many_), they needed to be whole before they could be truly productive.

Through coaching, I’d estimate that about 75% of their challenges in their positions is directly related to whatever personal issues they bring to work with them.  They hide behind their exterior business clothes or uniforms and polished shoes yet the carry their personal baggage with them everywhere they go.   Anything from domestic abuse at home (that carries across all ethnic, cultural and income levels) to learning they have cancer to depression and alcoholism.  Just because they look good on the outside, does not mean they do not need help on the inside.  I never thought I’d be the type to use the analogy of a car, but it’s one everyone can relate to:  it might look good on the outside, but if you do not take care of its foundation and structure and get an oil change and tune up once in a while, you can’t expect it to keep going.  It’s really that simple.

When I learned about chaplains in the workplace, I was thinking “Eureka!  FINALLY, someone is getting it!”  I really admired what Steve Cook started and really respected the businesses that took the initiative and had the courage to try something new in their companies.  I recommend all business owners consider corporate chaplains for their companies so they can “cover the core” of their employees so the foundation is ready for them to accomplish their goals.

To make a long story short, Steve and I connected and have partnered with our dual mission.   We are now both on fire for the very special opportunity to provide not only chaplaincy care for the employees so they can be more productive at work, but to help businesses succeed by first taking care of their most obvious assets – their employees.
