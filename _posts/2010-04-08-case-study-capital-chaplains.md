title: Case Study: Capital Chaplains
---
This document_ &#8220;follows the growth and development of Capital Chaplains from its initial stages as an idea in 2004 to when it reached sustainability as a full-time venture in 2009.&#8221; _(six pages of text and three pages of graphsâ€”2999 words)

_&#8220;As you approach your own chaplaincy initiative, there will always be lessons that can be learned, and ideas that can be borrowed, from those who have walked this road before. You will need to determine what unique features will characterize your organization and help you to best serve the needs of your community, but you can use the information that you gain from the experiences, ideas, and even the mistakes of others to put together a business plan that will best match your leadership style with the ideal way to meet those needs.&#8221;_
