title: What is corporate chaplaincy and what is a workplace chaplain?
---
Much like military chaplains care for soldiers and their families, corporate chaplaincy provides a chaplain in the workplace to care for employees and their families.

Chaplains are there to assure that employees do not have to feel alone when life gets overwhelming; they also assure that managers are not alone when trying to deal with the complex personal situations that employees bring to work. As chaplains build relationships with employees, they are available to provide support and encouragement when things are going well; they are also there to help facilitate creative problem solving when employees are struggling with any number of personal issues.

Having a chaplain onsite offers a personal, voluntary, and confidential employee care benefit available to all employees, their households, and their immediate family members. While the employer sponsors this benefit, it is offered by an outside chaplaincy provider.

Corporate chaplaincy makes it possible to have a caring, compassionate chaplain available to serve all employees, managers, and owners 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.

In a nutshell, chaplains help employees connect with the resources they need in order to reduce stress and help the organization to run more smoothly. In this way, a workplace or corporate chaplain is a dealer in hope and works to advance the common good. Chaplains come alongside people every day, offering the ministry of presence.

We, chaplains, provide help and hope one person at a time in the workplace.
