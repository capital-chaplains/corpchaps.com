It has been said that great ideas change the world. I believe workplace chaplaincy is truly a great idea that is changing the world one person at a time.

My name is Steve Cook, and in 2005 I started a company called Capital Chaplains LLC (CapChaps.Org). Six years later, this company is still the only provider of workplace chaplains throughout the Capital Region of South-Central Wisconsin. In six years we have grown to serve eleven client organizations with a team of six part-time chaplains.

Immediately after launching Capital Chaplains, I began to receive inquiries from a diverse group of people from around the United States who were, in general, intrigued with the idea of workplace chaplaincy, and who were, in particular, fascinated with our for-profit model of chaplaincy delivery. I would usually spend about and an hour or more on the phone with each inquirer, answering their questions and sharing lessons I had learned over time. Inevitably, I would follow-up with numerous pertinent email attachments.

By 2010, I still had a strong desire to serve this growing group of people, but the amount of time I had to commit to the increasing number of interested callers was dwindling, and I found that both they and I would be best served if the years of research and lessons learned could be compiled in one central location. As a result, we launched Corporate Chaplaincy Consulting (CorpChaps.Com), whose sole purpose is to “mentor and equip emerging workplace chaplains.”

The launch of this blog is simply a natural outgrowth of both the CapChaps.Org and the CorpChaps.Com initiatives, as we work to bring workplace chaplaincy to more people around the country, and help those who wish to serve as workplace chaplains have the tools they need to do so.

I would love for you to interact with the workplace chaplaincy ideas and lessons learned presented in these posts.

Welcome and stay tuned.

Steve
