title: Corporate Chaplaincy Consulting Leads in the Field
---
&#8220;Corporate Chaplaincy Consulting under the leadership of Steve Cook fills an important need in assisting those who serve employees and build healthy organizational cultures. Over the years, I&#8217;ve watched corporate chaplaincy grow in breadth and depth. As the field has matured, market leaders have emerged. **I count Corporate Chaplaincy Consulting as one of the vanguards.**&#8221;
