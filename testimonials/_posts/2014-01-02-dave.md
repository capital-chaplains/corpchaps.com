title: Dave Pursues His Calling
---
&#8220;Steve Cook, of Corporate Chaplaincy Consulting, was **extremely beneficial in the development stages of creating my own chaplaincy program** for the Houston area. During my initial research of chaplaincy programs, my conversations with Steve confirmed the possibility of creating a uniquely personal service program that God had laid on my heart. His **knowledge, experience, and detailed day-to-day operating wisdom** gave me the context necessary in which to pursue my calling. Thank you, Steve, for the assistance you have been in my journey of chaplaincy work.&#8221;
