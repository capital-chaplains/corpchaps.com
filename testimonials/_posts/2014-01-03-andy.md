&#8220;Steve Cook and his team have been instrumental in the development of my business from before it was a graduate thesis until my official launch. He is an incredible resource, and has provided a wealth of information relating to the start-up of my venture. The shadow day that was spent with Steve, his chaplains, his development team, and his clients **answered many outstanding questions that had lingered** and enabled me to witness the heart of his organization. Over the last few years, **Steve has become a trusted friend and colleague,** and I recommend his services very highly.&#8221;
