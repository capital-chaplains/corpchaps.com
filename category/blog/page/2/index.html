					<h2><em>What is corporate chaplaincy and what is a workplace chaplain?</em></h2>	
			<p>Much like military chaplains care for soldiers and their families, corporate chaplaincy provides a chaplain in the workplace to care for employees and their families.</p>
<p>Chaplains are there to assure that employees do not have to feel alone when life gets overwhelming; they also assure that managers are not alone when trying to deal with the complex personal situations that employees bring to work. As chaplains build relationships with employees, they are available to provide support and encouragement when things are going well; they are also there to help facilitate creative problem solving when employees are struggling with any number of personal issues.</p>
<p>Having a chaplain onsite offers a personal, voluntary, and confidential employee care benefit available to all employees, their households, and their immediate family members. While the employer sponsors this benefit, it is offered by an outside chaplaincy provider.</p>
<p>Corporate chaplaincy makes it possible to have a caring, compassionate chaplain available to serve all employees, managers, and owners 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, chaplains help employees connect with the resources they need in order to reduce stress and help the organization to run more smoothly. In this way, a workplace or corporate chaplain is a dealer in hope and works to advance the common good. Chaplains come alongside people every day, offering the ministry of presence.</p>
<p>We, chaplains, provide help and hope one person at a time in the workplace.</p>

					<h2><em>Introducing a great team</em></h2>	
			<p>Behind the implementation of every great idea is a great team. As the point person for that team, it is important to not only know your strengths, but to see the strengths in others that compliment yours, and bring those people together to work with you.</p>
<p>I am pleased to introduce the initial workplace chaplaincy blog contributors associated with the CapChaps.Org and CorpChaps.Com sites.</p>
<p>I am delighted that Cindy Liu, writer and researcher, will be one of the blog contributors. Cindy and I have collaborated on much of the material found on the CapChaps.Org and CorpChaps.Com sites. Through her many hours of workplace chaplaincy research and writing, and through her thoughtful contribution to this emerging field, Cindy has become a de facto expert in the field of workplace chaplaincy. Watch for Cindy’s insights as she shares much of what she has learned about both the theory and practice of workplace chaplaincy.</p>
<p>The third key contributor in this initial blog launch is Diane Hanson: Development Director with Capital Chaplains, corporate chaplain, and owner of a revenue development company she founded called Thinking In Sync LLC. She is also the author of the book entitled Full Circle: Fulfilling the Promise. Diane brings an amazing ability to incorporate spiritual caregiving with sound business principles. Watch for Diane’s insights into both the business and personal Return on Investment found in workplace chaplaincy.</p>
<p>We will also be inviting guest contributors to blog from time to time.</p>
<p>I want to thank two additional members of our Social Media Team: Matt Cook, who takes care of all things technical and programmable for us, and Carrie Vick, who serves as our Social Media Intern.</p>

					<h2><em>An Introduction</em></h2>	
			<p>It has been said that great ideas change the world. I believe workplace chaplaincy is truly a great idea that is changing the world one person at a time.</p>
<p>My name is Steve Cook, and in 2005 I started a company called Capital Chaplains LLC (CapChaps.Org). Six years later, this company is still the only provider of workplace chaplains throughout the Capital Region of South-Central Wisconsin. In six years we have grown to serve eleven client organizations with a team of six part-time chaplains.</p>
<p>Immediately after launching Capital Chaplains, I began to receive inquiries from a diverse group of people from around the United States who were, in general, intrigued with the idea of workplace chaplaincy, and who were, in particular, fascinated with our for-profit model of chaplaincy delivery. I would usually spend about and an hour or more on the phone with each inquirer, answering their questions and sharing lessons I had learned over time. Inevitably, I would follow-up with numerous pertinent email attachments.</p>
<p>By 2010, I still had a strong desire to serve this growing group of people, but the amount of time I had to commit to the increasing number of interested callers was dwindling, and I found that both they and I would be best served if the years of research and lessons learned could be compiled in one central location. As a result, we launched Corporate Chaplaincy Consulting (CorpChaps.Com), whose sole purpose is to “mentor and equip emerging workplace chaplains.”</p>
<p>The launch of this blog is simply a natural outgrowth of both the CapChaps.Org and the CorpChaps.Com initiatives, as we work to bring workplace chaplaincy to more people around the country, and help those who wish to serve as workplace chaplains have the tools they need to do so.</p>
<p>I would love for you to interact with the workplace chaplaincy ideas and lessons learned presented in these posts.</p>
<p>Welcome and stay tuned.</p>
<p>Steve<br />
