**Karen Miller, Office Manager at A&amp;J Specialties**, reminds us of the importance of confidentiality in the chaplaincy program. “Anything you talk to Mickey about is kept confidential, and that’s nice, because I don’t know who you can totally trust within an organization that is allowed to keep everything confidential.” As the office manager, she sees how comfortable everyone is with the corporate chaplain, and they all know that he is there to talk about anything. He was there for Miller when she dealt with the loss of her father and her mother-in-law, but he also tries to know what is going on in everyone’s life to celebrate, such as the when her grandchildren were born and her son got married. Watch this video to see more about why Miller feels: “With the chaplaincy program, you know that you’re just speaking to somebody that has your interest at heart.”
