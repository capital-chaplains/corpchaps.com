**Barb Moore, Receptionist at InterVarsity**, talks about how the chaplaincy program has strengthened the community and improved the work environment. Talking to the chaplain has personally allowed her to decompress when work or family issues have come up, and she has also seen this benefit for the organization as a whole. “Before, people would walk around, sometimes with an attitude or issues that they really didn’t know what to do with or who to talk to…” With a chaplain to available for employees to talk through issues, “you can see the difference in people’s interactions with one another. … You don’t have the same tension level.” Watch this video to see how Moore has seen the chaplaincy program positively effect almost every corner of the organization.
