**Diane Hanson** talks about why she serves as a corporate chaplain. “I enjoy helping people when they’re going through struggles.” Hanson understands that to get through life most people put up walls. Her hope is to build relationships with people and help them to let down those walls enough to get the help they need to deal with the struggles of life. With permission to share, Hanson is able to highlight the benefits that she has seen in the life of one employee by sharing briefly about the interactions that they have had. Hanson feels that the relational nature of the chaplaincy program allows employees to meet and get to know the chaplains before a crisis hits, making it easier to turn to them when help is needed. Incorporating her background in business and her desire to help those in need, watch this video to see why Hanson chose to get involved with workplace chaplaincy, and why she feels that it’s what’s missing in business.
