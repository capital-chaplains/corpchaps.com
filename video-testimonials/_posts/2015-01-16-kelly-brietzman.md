**Kelly Brietzman, Operations Coordinator at Pellitteri Waste Systems**, knows first hand the important role that corporate chaplains play in the lives of employees. For her and her husband,the divorce papers were signed and notarized; they just hadn’t sent them in. “Steve was the stepping stone to me and my husband saving our marriage.” Steve helped them get a counselor and went back and forth between her and her husband. Watch this video to hear her story, and to hear how Brietzman sees the chaplain as someone who has not only been there to listen to her, but who has helped other employees by providing a sounding board for many people at the company.
