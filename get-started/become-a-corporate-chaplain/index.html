<p><em>“Consistency and Variety<br />
Some corporate chaplains work part-time and serve onsite a few hours each week; others work fulltime and visit one or more sites every day, Monday through Friday.

<h3>Profile: Workplace Chaplain and Local Church Pastor</h3>
<p>This document shares the experiences and insights of a local church pastor who is currently serving part-time as a workplace chaplain (two pages—989 words).</p>
<p><em>“As the sole pastor of a small church, Mickey recognizes that the amount of time that can be devoted to ministry is endless; you can always do more, pray more, and study more. While he didn’t feel that he had the time to add anything else to his busy schedule, he made time. Two years ago, when Mickey was presented with the opportunity to work as a part-time chaplain, he saw it as an extension of his ministry—and an opportunity to help him support his family of five. … While the employees benefit from Mickey’s consistency, encouragement, and desire to listen, he has found that he benefits from his time with them as well. …”</em></p>
<h3>Profile: Workplace Chaplain and Social Worker</h3>
<p>This document shares the experiences and insights of a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) who is currently serving part-time as a workplace chaplain (over two pages—1141 words).</p>
<p><em>“Long before beginning her work as a chaplain, Sue made the decision to organize her fulltime work responsibilities so that they could be completed in four days each week. … When the opportunity arose to spend a few hours each Friday serving as a chaplain, Sue discovered that it was an excellent fit for her interests and her strengths. By dedicating just twelve to fifteen hours each month to chaplaincy, Sue has found a way to serve her community, supplement her income, and still enjoy her Fridays. …”</em></p>
<h3>Profile: Workplace Chaplain and retired EAP Provider</h3>

<p><em>“When Shell joined the State Bar of Wisconsin as an employee, it didn’t take her long to see the many needs of the lawyers with whom she worked. … The American Bar Association had a rudimentary assistance program for lawyers at that time, and Shell was able to formally begin her service as an EAP (Employee Assistance Program) provider. … After two years of retirement—which she considers a much-needed extended vacation—Shell saw an article in the paper about a local corporate chaplaincy provider. … Shell was hired. …”</em></p>
