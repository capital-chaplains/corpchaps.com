Do you sense there are things you could be doing better with your chaplaincy business, but you don't quite know where to start?

Or do you feel like you're heading in the right direction, but would like a fresh set of eyes to fine-tune the ideas you've already developed?

High performers in any field typically have a coach or mentor. Likewise, whether you're starting a new chaplaincy organization or growing an existing business, hiring Steve Cook for an on-site consultation can be a cost-effective way to leverage his specialized knowledge.

### Here's what's included when you purchase the Bring Steve to You package:

## 8-12 Hours of On-Site Consultation

Together, you and Steve will craft an itinerary for the day that is tailor-made for your goals and context.

Steve can provide a veteran point of view and evaluation that could be the shortcut to the knowledge, skills, and strategies you need to propel your chaplaincy organization forward.

*   vision casting
*   strategizing
