Do you want to reach your chaplaincy business goals faster? Or, if you’re new to corporate chaplaincy altogether, do you want to find out whether it’s the right field for you? There’s just no comparison for firsthand experience.

Take a step closer to achieving your goals by talking to and observing those who’ve been working as corporate chaplains for years.

The Shadow a Corporate Chaplain package gives you two distinct opportunities to grow your business and yourself: one-on-one phone consulting and on-site shadowing.

### Here’s what’s included when you Shadow a Corporate Chaplain:

## Two-Hour Phone Consultation
Steve Cook, owner of Corporate Chaplaincy Consulting, LLC, is available to answer any questions you feel will move you forward toward your chaplaincy goals.

From the convenience of your own home or office, you’ll receive Steve’s undivided attention and the hard-won wisdom of more than a decade of experience.

Steve will both answer your questions and ask you questions that will further your discussion. Together, you’ll determine areas of growth for your chaplaincy skills and business ownership, and outline your next steps.

You can use this time to:

*   Learn new strategies or tweak those that aren’t working for you
*   Talk through certain challenges you’ve faced so far
*   Refine your pitch to prospective client companies
*   Get further explanation of any topics from the [Consider Corporate Chaplaincy Kit](/get-started/consider-corporate-chaplaincy/) or the [Start a Chaplaincy Business Kit](/get-started/start-your-chaplaincy-business/)Start Your Chaplaincy Business Kit (both resources are recommended but not required prior to the phone consultation)

The phone consultation is ultimately led by you, and Steve will work to insure you get the most out of your call. You’ll be best prepared for the call by compiling a list of discussion topics and questions and sending them to Steve ahead of time to insure your call addresses as many of your needs as possible in the allotted time.

*Note: You can use the entire two hours in one session or divide it into two one-hour sessions.*
