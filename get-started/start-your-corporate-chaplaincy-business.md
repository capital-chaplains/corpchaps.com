Would you like to make an even bigger difference in the lives of individuals and organizations?

So many businesses need the help that chaplains like you offer ‒ and you can help by starting a for-profit corporate chaplaincy in your area. And with minimal competition in this emerging industry, chaplaincy as a for-profit business has tremendous growth potential in the marketplace. Now is a great time to start!

The Start Your Chaplaincy Business Kit is designed to help you make the shift from serving as an individual chaplain to owning a chaplaincy organization, whether you've been a chaplain for years or have only recently been inspired by our [Consider Corporate Chaplaincy Kit](/get-started/consider-corporate-chaplaincy/).

The combination of resources in the Start Your Chaplaincy Business Kit—spanning a 75-page ebook, sample legal and business documents, multimedia marketing materials, and a personal consultation—will give you the expert guidance you need to establish a sustainable chaplaincy business.
