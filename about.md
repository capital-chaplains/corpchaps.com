![Steve Cook]({{ site.imagefolder }}SteveCookheadshot.jpg) Welcome to the Corporate Chaplaincy Consulting website, where **our mission is to mentor and equip emerging workplace chaplains.**

In the midst of our fractured, high-stress world, people need a safe place to talk through problems. Even more, they need someone to walk with them in the midst of difficult circumstances.

My name is Steve Cook, and since 2005 when I started Capital Chaplains LLC, a corporate chaplaincy initiative based near Madison that serves the entire capital region of south central Wisconsin, it’s been my privilege to meet that need for employees in diverse organizations. **I’d love to help you start your own corporate chaplaincy business so that organizations in your area can also experience the gifts a corporate chaplain brings to individual employees and to businesses as a whole.**

I know from my own life that the shift from serving as a chaplain to owning a chaplaincy organization can feel like a big one. But the sole mission of Corporate Chaplaincy Consulting is to mentor and equip emerging corporate chaplains like yourself. The resources I provide offer **step-by-step guidance for your journey**, from building relationships with local business owners and marketing your organization to providing ongoing training for the chaplains you hire as part of your team.

The journey takes patience and perseverance, but I’ve seen God lead and sustain me in incredible ways. After several years of leading Capital Chaplains part-time while working as a pastor and then in a non-profit, it now provides my full income and full-time work. I have also contracted six other part-time chaplains to assist me.

Even more, today, Capital Chaplains has contracts to provide a Chaplain Assistance Program for every employee and related family/household member in each of nine client organizations. And it experienced some of its greatest growth during the worst recession since the Great Depression. Five of the nine Capital Chaplains client companies started chaplaincy programs in 2009 alone!

So many organizations need the help that chaplains can offer. **Perhaps God is calling you to be part of the solution in your city.** I’d love to walk with you as you consider starting a corporate chaplaincy initiative of your own.
