## What is a corporate chaplain?

*   A corporate chaplain is a dealer in hope.
*   A corporate chaplain works to advance the common good.
*   A corporate chaplain practices the Ministry of Presence on a daily basis.
*   A corporate chaplain provides help and hope one person at a time.

## Why consider a career as a corporate chaplain?

*   Perhaps you enjoy serving people and thrive on building hope in others.
*   Perhaps you are a social worker who is searching for a new job.
*   Perhaps you are a professional counselor who is looking for a career change.
*   Perhaps you are looking for some extra income but don’t have the time or resources to go back to school and retrain for a new occupation.
*   Perhaps you want to move into the retirement phase of life but feel that your work is not finished.
*   Perhaps you are a pastor in search of a new calling—after spending years in ministry as a pastor, you find that your time is now spent leading programs, raising money, and overseeing a church campus, rather than ministering directly to people—and now you feel that you are being called back to a profession where you can once again minister directly to people.

Different people come to corporate chaplaincy from different backgrounds and for different reasons. Whether you have been laid-off, are currently feeling burned-out, or are searching for a new calling, if you can relate to any of the above, serving as corporate chaplain may be right for you. CorpChaps.Com is designed to be a step-by-step guide to show you how to get started.

## Who could be a corporate chaplain?

*   Hospital or military chaplains
*   Pastors, priests, and ministers
*   Counselors or social workers
*   Spiritual directors, para-church staff, Stephen Ministers, and other lay-church leaders and staff
*   Marketplace leaders who are people of faith and have experience leading and coming along-side others

The vast majority of the approximately 4,000 corporate chaplains currently serving in the United States are professionally trained in another discipline. Because of their transferable skills, they are now able to serve successfully as chaplains in the workplace with only a small amount of additional training.
