**Summary Video:** Life happens. Employees are living the new normal: “We’re at work all day, every day, for our whole lives, and there’s obviously things that are happening outside of work that would potentially affect every aspect of your life, not just when you’re outside of work, but also when you’re in work.” Supervisors want to help: “When you have a person in crisis, you both want to care for the person, but you also have to make up for the fact that they’re not being productive.” More and more business owners are seeing these trends, and they are looking to corporate chaplains for help. Watch this video to see how their companies and their employees are enjoying the benefits of having a corporate chaplain in the workplace.
