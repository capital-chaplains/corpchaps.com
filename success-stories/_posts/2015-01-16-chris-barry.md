**Chris Barry, a welder at Dane Manufacturing**, talks about the benefits of a corporate chaplain in a predominantly male work environment. “It helps keep the peace in the shop. A lot of the guys will sit there and talk about this guy and that guy.” While this “shop talk” may be the norm,Barry admits that when they discuss these issues with the chaplain, “It helps to talk about stuff like that. The chaplain I think really does help with personal problems, problems on the shop,conflicts with other employees, and financial, marital, depression, everything.” Watch this video to see why Barry thinks having a chaplain around really helps the guys in the shop, and why he feels that corporate chaplaincy really makes sense for a blue collar work environment.
