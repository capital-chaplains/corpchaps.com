**Shell Goar** talks about the path that led her to be a corporate chaplain: beginning as a teenager when she was told that going into ministry was not an option for girls, and leading up to her retirement from her work as an EAP provider after suffering from compassion fatigue. After a couple years of retirement, she now has the opportunity to serve in the ministry as a corporate chaplain, and she loves it. “I’d love to share a lot of chaplaincy stories with you,” Shell begins, “however, probably our greatest gift to give anyone here is the gift of confidentiality and of privacy.” With permission, she shares one interaction, one way that she came alongside someone to help them see a difficult life situation in a new way, as a gift. Watch this video to see why Shell sees the opportunity to serve as a corporate chaplain as a gift, and to better understand gifts that she is able to share with others.
