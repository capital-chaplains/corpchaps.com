**Nou Her, Donations Services Assistant at InterVarsity**, talks about how the chaplaincy program has impacted her personally. Through a very chaotic time, it was helpful “just having someone there to tell my problems to… and to relate on a level that we are all humans.” Having someone trusted there to talk with and help her put things in perspective also helped Her to realize that when “I go through certain things that I go through in life, it’s essential that I not carry it alone.” When life gets chaotic, it can be difficult to know where to turn for peace and perspective. “What I really love about Capital Chaplains is the confidentiality of that, and to be able to go to a secure, safe, and trustful place.” Watch this video to see how Her feels the chaplains helped her to get her life back on track, and why she is now back to being able to give 110% at work.
