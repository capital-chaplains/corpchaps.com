**Karon Morton, Vice President and Director of Operations at InterVarsity**, discusses the tragedy that initiated the launch of a workplace chaplaincy program at InterVarsity’s NationalService Center (Madison, Wisconsin) and, as a manager, the benefits that she has seen since the implementation of the program. After the tragedy, Morton saw “such a pervasive effect on our community, most of us as managers didn’t feel that we had either the capacity or the expertise to help people walk through and deal with their thoughts and their feelings and their disappointments.” On a day to day basis, Morton acknowledges, “When you have a person in crisis, you both want to care for the person, but you also have to make up for the fact that they’re not being productive. They may be out for an extended period of time, or there may be fallout from their inability to perform their job function.” Like many managers, Morton believes that people are the most important asset in the organization, and they need to be cared for as such.Watch this video to see why Morton feels that having a corporate chaplain come alongside employees not only helps managers to care for their employees, but it also assures that managers are available to do their jobs with a higher level of productivity so that the organization can continue to run smoothly.
